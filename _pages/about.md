## About me
Hello, my name is Simon van der Veldt. I am a tinkerer, motorsports engineer and a minimalist who loves to create things from bits and bytes and physical materials :)

I have a very broad range of interests, from home automation to suspension design for motorsports to mobile web design and making coffee. Knowing all the ins and outs and staying on the bleeding edge of current developments on all of these fields is what I do in my spare time.
I use this blog to write about these random things.

For my professional information have a look at my [LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/simonvanderveldt).
