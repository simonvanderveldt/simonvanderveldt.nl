    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>Creating is my passion. Making digital things using the awesome new (web) technologies we have at our disposal nowadays is the biggest part of this, but I also love designing and engineering physical products.</p>

    <p>Sharing my passion and knowledge on these subjects is a natural part of making things for me. That's why you can find me at several <a href="http://www.meetup.com/members/69428212/" target="_blank">meetups</a>, I post on this blog and you can find anything I create on my <a href="https://github.com/simonvanderveldt" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>

    <p>Professionally I am experienced in Software Requirements and Specifications, Test Management and Test Automation and working in Agile (Scrum) teams.

    <p>Simplicity, modularity and high-quality are the pillars on which I base everything I create.</p>

            <p class="description">Since the day the <A href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTC_Dream" target="_blank">T-Mobile G1</a> was released I've been using various Android devices and custom roms. Currently I'm running <a href="http://www.cyanogenmod.org" target="_blank">CyanogenMod</a>, but I'm looking forward to give <a href="http://omnirom.org/" target="_blank">OmniROM</a> a try.
            <br>Since that same day I've been making mobile websites. Back then with special mobile versions, nowadays all of them are responsive (mobile first!) using the awesome new possibilities that HTML5, CSS3 and javascript give us.
            <br>I hope that with all these possibilities and with the advent of <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/os/" target="_blank">Firefox OS</a>, <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/phone" target="_blank">Ubuntu for phones</a>, <A href="https://www.tizen.org/" target="_blank">Tizen</a> and <a href="http://jolla.com/" target="_blank">Jolla</a>/<a href="https://sailfishos.org/" target="_blank">Sailfish OS</a> the development of mobile apps using web technologies is finally becoming a first class citizen. Writing your front-end once and using it on every platform is something that should make every developer happy :)</p>

I help people with setting up their suspension and dampers. Apart from that I'm always working on my long running project, a '75 Super Beetle with Porsche 944 M030 suspension and Boxster brakes. The engine is still stock though :) More info on <a href="http://1303rs.nl" target="_blank">1303rs.nl</a>.
            <br>Currently I'm working on a custom pair of coil-over dampers for the front suspension.</p>
